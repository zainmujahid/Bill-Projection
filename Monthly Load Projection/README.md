## Steps to successfully evaluate/run the code:

-  Add unzipped folder in the path directory of MATLAB
-  load_projection.m is the main script.
-  Run load_projection.m and CLICK ON COMMAND WINDOW.
-  Simply follow the lead shown in Command Window.
-  The script will repeatedly ask you to press Enter in order to proceed.
-  Every output can be seen in command window, we tried our best to make it as simple to undertand as we could.
-  An input prompt will ask you to Enter Month from 1-12 for which you want to project bill, DO NOT PRESS ENTER HERE.
-  If you get an error during step 6, Just re-run the script and avoid pressing Enter in step 6
-  If any convergence plot starts to rise with increase in iterations, try decreasing the value of Alpha in the respected script.
-  Just keep pressing Enter in command window and enjoy the script.
- Code is well commented and easy to evaluate.
